 ALGORITHM FOR TRADITIONAL APPROACH:(without hashing)

1.	Start
2.	Input the number of elements of an array.
3.	Input the array elements.
4.	Create another array to store the frequency of elements.
5.	Traverse the input array and update the count of the elements in the frequency array.
6.	Print the frequency array which displays the frequency of all the elements of the array.
7.	End

 ALGORITHM FOR OPTIMIZED APPROACH:(with hashing)

1.	Start
2.	Input the number of elements of the array.
3.	Input the array elements.
4.	Create a hash table and update the element in one column and its frequency in the other column.
5.	Print the element along with its frequency.
6.	End
